🔭 I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. You can check out some of my work here or more on my website!

🌲 I was previously at Blackberry QNX working as a Systems Software Intern on the Command Line Tools team. I worked on QNX utilities and features for one of the world's most widely-used real-time kernels.

🌱 I was also previously working at the University of Waterloo [Print and Retail Solutions](https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca/pages/w-print) doing development on their website all while maintaining IT infrastructure for operators and buyers.

🛠️ I am also a member at [Waterloo Reality Labs](https://uwrealitylabs.com/), a design team looking to build in house headsets from the ground up.
